# RapidStream TAPA

The RapidStream TAPA framework enables users to design high-frequency FPGA dataflow accelerators. The framework has two key components:

- The TAPA frontend provides API for expressing task-parallel accelerators in C++ and compiles
  the design into Verilog RTL.

- The RapidStream backend optimizes the generated RTL for high frequency and partitions the
  design for parallel placement and routing.

The framework originated from the [VAST Lab](https://vast.cs.ucla.edu/) at UCLA. Now it is maintained by RapidStream Design Automation, Inc.

## Installation

The RapidStream-TAPA toolchain can be installed with a single command. After the installation completes successfully, restart your terminal session or follow the instructions to add the toolchain to your `PATH`. You can upgrade your installation at any time by repeating the installation command.

To install TAPA, you need to have the following dependencies:

- Ubuntu 18.04 or later, or Debian 10 or later:
    - `iverilog`
    - `g++` and `ocl-icd-libopencl1` if you plan to run simulations and on-board tests
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 or later, AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux 9 or later, or Amazon Linux 2023:
    - `iverilog` built from source
    - `libxcrypt-compat`
    - `gcc-c++` and `ocl-icd` (if you plan to run simulations and on-board tests)
- Fedora 34 or later, up to Fedora 38:
    - `iverilog`
    - `libxcrypt-compat`
    - `gcc-c++` and `ocl-icd` (if you plan to run simulations and on-board tests)
    - Newer versions of Fedora are not supported by Vitis HLS, but for some designs, TAPA might still work.
- Vitis HLS 2022.1 or later

You can install the dependencies and TAPA by running the following commands:

```bash
# for Ubuntu and Debian
sudo apt-get install g++ iverilog ocl-icd-libopencl1

# or for Fedora, RHEL, and Amazon Linux
sudo yum install gcc-c++ iverilog libxcrypt-compat ocl-icd

# Install TAPA
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL tapa.rapidstream.sh)"

# Install RapidStream
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL rapidstream.sh)"
```

For more details, please refer to the [documentation](https://tapa.readthedocs.io/en/main/).


## High-Frequency

- TAPA explicitly decouples communication and computation for better QoR.
- TAPA integrates the [RapidStream Composer](https://rapidstream-da.com/) to optimize the RTL generation process.
- TAPA achieves **2×** higher the frequency on average compared to Vivado. [<sup>1</sup>](https://doi.org/10.1145/3431920.3439289)

## Speed

- TAPA compiles **7×** faster than Vitis HLS. [<sup>2</sup>](https://doi.org/10.1109/fccm51124.2021.00032)
- TAPA provides **3×** faster software simulation than Vitis HLS.[<sup>2</sup>](https://doi.org/10.1109/fccm51124.2021.00032)
- TAPA provides **8×** faster RTL simulation than Vitis.
- TAPA is integrating [RapidStream Composer](https://rapidstream-da.com/) that
  is up to **10×** faster than Vivado.

## Expressiveness

- TAPA extends the Vitis HLS syntax for richer expressiveness at the C++ level.
- TAPA provides dedicated APIs for arbitrary external memory access patterns.
- TAPA allows users to explicitly specify parallelism.
- In addition to static burst analysis, TAPA supports runtime burst detectuion by transparently merging small memory transactions into large bursts.

## HBM-Specific Optimizations

- TAPA significantly reduce the area overhead of HBM interface IPs compared to Vitis HLS.
- TAPA includes an automated design space exploration tool to balance the resource pressure and the wire pressure for HBM FPGAs.
- TAPA automatically select the physical channel for each top-level argument of your accelerator.

## Successful Cases

- [Serpens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12555), DAC'22, achieves 270 MHz on the Xilinx Alveo U280 HBM board when using 24 HBM channels. The Vitis HLS baseline failed in routing.
- [Sextans](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3490422.3502357), FPGA'22, achieves 260 MHz on the Xilinx Alveo U250 board when using 4 DDR channels. The Vivado baseline achieves only 189 MHz.
- [SPLAG](https://github.com/UCLA-VAST/splag), FPGA'22,
  achieves up to a 4.9× speedup over state-of-the-art FPGA accelerators,
  up to a 2.6× speedup over 32-thread CPU running at 4.4 GHz,
  and up to a 0.9× speedup over an A100 GPU
  (that has 4.1× power budget and 3.4× HBM bandwidth).
- [AutoSA Systolic-Array Compiler](https://github.com/UCLA-VAST/AutoSA),
  FPGA'21:
  ![AutoSA Frequency Figure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32432619/157976148-594e98bc-2658-4ebc-ae0d-3d2a347d1854.png)
- [KNN](https://github.com/SFU-HiAccel/CHIP-KNN), FPT'20, achieves 252 MHz on the Xilinx Alveo U280 board. The Vivado baseline achieves only 165 MHz.
