Real-World Examples
----------------------

The TAPA repo also includes a set of large scale designs under the
``regression`` directory. This directory is in active development and we are
adding more sophiticated TAPA designs here.

- ``cnn`` and ``lu_decomposition`` are both systolic arrays (of different
  shape) originally published in `FPGA'21
  <https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3431920.3439292>`_.

- ``hbm-bandwidth`` can be used to profile the HBM bandwidth. It reads from and
  write back to all 32 channels of HBM. It is a good demonstration of the
  expressiveness and the optimized area of ``async_mmap``.

- ``hbm-bandwidth-1-ch`` only reads from and writes to one HBM channel.

- ``serpens`` is a sparse matrix-vector multiplication published in `DAC'22
  <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12555.pdf>`_. We provide different versions that
  are of the same architecture but different parallelism.

- ``spmm`` is a sparse matrix-matrix multiplication published in `FPGA'22
  <https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3490422.3502357>`_

- ``spmv-hisparse-mmap`` is another sparse matrix-vector multiplication
  published in `HiSparse
  <https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~zhiruz/pdfs/spmv-fpga2022.pdf>`_ at FPGA'22

- ``knn`` is a K-nearest-neighbor accelerator originally published in `FPT'20
  <http://www.sfu.ca/~zhenman/files/C19-FPT2020-CHIP-KNN.pdf>`_

- ``page_rank`` is an accelerator for the Page-Rank algorithm that is included
  in `FCCM'21 <https://about.blaok.me/pub/fccm21-tapa.pdf>`_
