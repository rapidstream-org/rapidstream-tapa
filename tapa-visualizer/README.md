# TAPA Visualizer

A TAPA task visualizer built with [AntV G6](https://g6.antv.antgroup.com/).

## Usage

1. As of now, AntV G6 is served from npm CDN `unpkg.com`.

   > Modify line 22 of `index.html` if you can't access it.

2. Loading the webpage:

   - Serve `index.html`, `css/*`, and `js/*` with any HTTPd server,
     then open it with any browser.

   - Or just open `index.html` with your browser.

   > However, if you need to open it directly through `file://` URI on Firefox,
     You may have to disable `security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy`.
     This do affect security, disable it at your own risk. If you don't know
     what that is, fallback to HTTPd server instead of play with security.

3. Use the file input at the left of the top bar to load the `graph.json` file
   generated by `tapa compile`.

   Use the `Rerender Graph` button to improve the layout for large graphs.

## Dev Notes

- `@antv/g6` works great, but it's filled with type definition bugs. Fixes in
[`g6.d.ts`](./types/g6.d.ts) amd `patch-package` are used for migration.
